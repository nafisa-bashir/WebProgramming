        <p style="margin-left: 15px;margin-top: -40px;font-size: 25px;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ;color: rgb(100, 91, 63);">LA ROSE is inspired by sense of place and season, which <br> is fundamental for our floral designs. 
            The process of <br> creating a floral arrangement involves many of the <br> same principles that go into making fine art. Balancing <br> colour with texture, seasonality, foliage and foraged <br>
            elements makes every arrangement unique piece of <br> art.  
            <br><br><br>

            We are committed to personalizing your experience by<br> offering more than just flowers. Each design has its <br> individual touch depending on seasonality, occasion and <br> your individual preference.<br><br><br>
            
            
            Our shop in DIFC serves as a beautifully curated retail <br>boutique, which allows for a truly delightful experience<br> for the senses that we hope to share with you. </p>
